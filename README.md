# Pulsar Edit MCP Server

| :warning: WARNING          |
|:---------------------------|
| Very experimental and incomplete. Use at your own risk!         |

This is an *early* attempt at making an MCP server to control the [Pulsar](https://github.com/pulsar-edit) editor. The goal is to enable an LLM to assist with software development in Pulsar using a tool like [AnythingLLM](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm) as a chat client.

## Installation:
```sh
ppm install https://github.com/drunnells/pulsar-edit-mcp-server
```

After the Pulsar package is installed, set the MCP server to lisen in **Packages**->**MCP Server**->**Listen**

You will see a "**MCP:On**" tile in the lower left of the Pulsar editor.

Your LLM MCP Client will need to have the below mcpServers configuration.

### mcpServers JSON:
```json
{
        "mcpServers": {
                "pulsar-edit-mcp-server": {
                        "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
                        "disabled": false,
                        "alwaysAllow": [],
                        "type": "streamable"
                }
        }
}
```

## Background
I've written a quick [blog post](https://dev.to/drunnells/creating-an-mcp-server-for-the-pulsar-editor-1m5) around my motivations and some of the challenges that I initially encountered.

# Contributing
This project is still in its very early stages. I'm hoping to turn it into something useful one day. If youâ€™re interested in helping shape it, any contribution is welcome and appreciated!
